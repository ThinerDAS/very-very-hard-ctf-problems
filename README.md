# Very very hard CTF problems

I have composed some CTF problems that is considered (by my teammates) infeasible and impractical. Can you solve them?

I have seen some CTF problems that are not friendly to human reversers. So I want to progress further.

I have tried to trim the miscellaneous part of the problem to make the problem have only one biggest challenge.

Contact me when you have solved them! I am REALLY, REALLY interested in knowing how one solves such problems.

The reverse problems contain following attributes:

* Complex and can not be dealt with by human mind directly
* Uses (a bit advanced) algorithm that is beyond reach of angr, z3, or anything similar
* I have not used the commonly considered harder algorithms (whitebox AES for example? good idea however I do not have much of time currently)
